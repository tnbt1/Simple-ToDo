# Deployment Fixes for Cross-Environment Compatibility

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes implemented to ensure the Todo app works perfectly in any environment with just `docker compose up -d` or `./scripts/quick-start.sh`.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Port Configuration Consistency
- **Problem**: Inconsistent port references between 3000 and 3100
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated `.env.example` to use port 3100 for `NEXTAUTH_URL`
  - Fixed `scripts/quick-start.sh` to check port 3100
  - Updated `Makefile` to show correct access URL

### 2. Database Migration Issues
- **Problem**: New feature tables (SharedTask, SharedCategory, etc.) were not created in fresh environments
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed migration file order - moved `CREATE TYPE "Permission"` before table creation
  - Changed `docker-compose.yml` to always use `npx prisma migrate deploy` instead of `db push`
  - This ensures all migrations are properly tracked and applied

### 3. Health Check Implementation
- **Problem**: Docker health check was failing
- **Solution**:
  - Created `/api/health` endpoint
  - Updated docker-compose.yml health check to use the new endpoint

### 4. Feature Testing
- **Problem**: No way to verify all features work in a new environment
- **Solution**:
  - Created `scripts/test-features.sh` to verify:
    - Application accessibility
    - API endpoints
    - Authentication system
    - Database connectivity
    - New feature tables
    - Static assets
    - Mobile responsiveness

## Key Changes

### docker-compose.yml
```yaml
# Before: Conditional migration approach
if [ "${NODE_ENV}" = "production" ]; then
  npx prisma migrate deploy;
else
  npx prisma db push --accept-data-loss;
fi;

# After: Always use migrations
echo 'ðŸ“‹ Applying database migrations...';
npx prisma migrate deploy;
```

### Migration File Fix
- Moved `CREATE TYPE "Permission"` to the beginning of the migration file
- Ensures enum type exists before tables that reference it

### Environment Configuration
- Standardized on port 3100 for external access
- Internal app still runs on port 3000 (mapped to 3100)

## Deployment Steps for New Environment

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `./scripts/quick-start.sh` OR:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   docker compose up -d
   ```
3. Wait ~30 seconds for services to start
4. Access the app at http://localhost:3100

## Verification

Run the test script to verify everything is working:
```bash
./scripts/test-features.sh
```

This will check:
- âœ… All services are running
- âœ… Database schema is correct
- âœ… All new feature tables exist
- âœ… API endpoints are responding
- âœ… Application is accessible

## Notes

- The app now consistently uses migrations in all environments
- Initial user creation happens on first access via the UI
- All sensitive keys are auto-generated if using defaults
- Health checks ensure services are ready before app starts
